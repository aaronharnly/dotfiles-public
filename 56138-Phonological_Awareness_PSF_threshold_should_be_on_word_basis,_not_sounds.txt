The "65% correct" threshold for the Phonological Awareness level 2 rule is intended to be on a *word* level, not a sound level. That is, a student should have a score > 15, and get > 65% of the attempted *words* correct.

To implement this specification properly, we required the ILA change detailed in Bug 54669.

This bug tracks the algorithm change that makes use of the new results from ILA, and the verification of the word-level skill thresholding.
