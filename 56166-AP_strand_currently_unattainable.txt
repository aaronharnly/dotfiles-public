eternal student sids: 160286891 (student sid: 160286892) 154486680 (student sid: 154486681)

What happens: All students in group are =2 in all measurable skill ratings. My understanding is this is criteria for a group advancing to the AP content, but the group's focus remains RW + LCb. Requesting a new burst results in "not enough strands" being returned.

Failed burst creation trace attached (zip file 26308).
